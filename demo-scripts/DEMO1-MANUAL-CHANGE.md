# Demo 1: Manual Change Detection and Drift Correction

## Overview
This demo demonstrates how ArgoCD detects manual changes made directly to OpenShift resources and automatically corrects the configuration drift by reverting to the state defined in Git.

## Prerequisites
- ArgoCD Operator installed and configured
- Workshop GitOps VMs development environment deployed
- Access to OpenShift cluster with `oc` CLI

## Environment Details
- **Namespace**: `workshop-gitops-vms-dev`
- **VM Name**: `dev-vm-web-01`
- **ArgoCD Application**: `workshop-gitops-vms-dev`
- **Git Run Strategy**: `Always` (VM should be running)
- **Manual Change**: Set `runStrategy` to `Halted` (stop the VM)

## Step-by-Step Manual Instructions

### Step 1: Check Current VM State and Application Status

1. Check the ArgoCD application status:
```bash
oc get applications.argoproj.io workshop-gitops-vms-dev -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.status.sync.status}'
```

```bash
oc get applications.argoproj.io workshop-gitops-vms-dev -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.status.health.status}'
```

2. Verify the VM exists and is running:
```bash
oc get vm dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
```

```bash
oc get vmi dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
```

3. Check the current runStrategy (should be "Always"):
```bash
oc get vm dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.runStrategy}'
```

**Expected Result**: VM should exist and be running with `runStrategy: Always`

### Step 2: Make Manual Change to Stop the VM

1. Apply a manual change to halt the VM:
```bash
oc patch vm dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev --type merge -p '{"spec":{"runStrategy":"Halted"}}'
```

2. Verify the change was applied:
```bash
oc get vm dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.runStrategy}'
```

**Expected Result**: `runStrategy` should now be "Halted"

### Step 3: Wait for VM to Shut Down

1. Monitor the VirtualMachineInstance deletion:
```bash
oc get vmi dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
```

2. Wait for the VMI to be completely removed:
```bash
oc get vmi dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
```

**Expected Result**: The VirtualMachineInstance should be deleted, confirming the VM has stopped

### Step 4: Force ArgoCD to Detect the Drift

1. Force application refresh to detect changes:
```bash
oc patch applications.argoproj.io workshop-gitops-vms-dev -n openshift-gitops --type merge -p '{"operation":{"initiatedBy":{"username":"admin"},"sync":{"revision":"HEAD"}}}'
```

2. Check application status repeatedly until drift is detected:
```bash
oc get applications.argoproj.io workshop-gitops-vms-dev -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.status.sync.status}'
```



**Expected Result**: Sync status should return to "Synced"

### Step 5: Verify Configuration Restoration

1. Check that the runStrategy has been reverted:
```bash
oc get vm dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.runStrategy}'
```

2. Wait for the VM to start again:
```bash
watch oc get vm dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev -o jsonpath='{.status.printableStatus}'
```

3. Verify the VirtualMachineInstance is running:
```bash
oc get vmi dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
```

**Expected Result**: 
- `runStrategy` should be back to "Always"
- VM status should be "Running"
- VirtualMachineInstance should exist and be ready

### Step 6: Final Verification

1. Check final application status:
```bash
oc get applications.argoproj.io workshop-gitops-vms-dev -n openshift-gitops -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,SYNC:.status.sync.status,HEALTH:.status.health.status"
```

2. List all VMs in the development environment:
```bash
oc get vm -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
```

**Expected Result**: Application should be "Synced" and "Healthy"

## Summary of What Was Demonstrated

✓ **Manual Change**: Made a direct change to VM configuration (stopped the VM)  
✓ **Drift Detection**: ArgoCD detected the configuration drift (OutOfSync status)  
✓ **Automatic Correction**: ArgoCD automatically reverted the change  
✓ **State Restoration**: VM was restarted with the correct Git-defined configuration  
✓ **GitOps Enforcement**: Demonstrated that Git is the single source of truth  

## Key Learning Points

- **Configuration Drift**: Manual changes to resources are detected by ArgoCD
- **Self-Healing**: GitOps automatically corrects unauthorized changes
- **Audit Trail**: All changes and corrections are logged in ArgoCD
- **Consistency**: Git repository remains the authoritative source of configuration
- **Operational Safety**: Prevents configuration drift in production environments

## Troubleshooting

If the demo doesn't work as expected:

1. **VM not found**: Ensure the development environment is properly deployed
2. **ArgoCD not detecting drift**: Try forcing a refresh with annotation:
   ```bash
   oc annotate applications.argoproj.io workshop-gitops-vms-dev -n openshift-gitops argocd.argoproj.io/refresh="$(date)" --overwrite
   ```
3. **VM not starting**: Check VM events and DataVolume status:
   ```bash
   oc describe vm dev-vm-web-01 -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
   ```
   ```bash
   oc get dv -n workshop-gitops-vms-dev
   ```
